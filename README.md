##  Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

Sure, you could copy-paste articles into ChatGPT...
But here’s why **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** makes all the difference:

*  **Context matters** – GPT can get confused with long/multiple inputs
*  **RAG = Smart search + LLM** – It pulls only what’s relevant
*  **Accurate, grounded answers** – Based on your actual sources
*  **Built-in citations** – Know exactly *where* answers came from

>  RAG gives you **faster, focused, factual** answers from **your sources**.
