🤔 Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?
Sure, you could copy-paste articles into ChatGPT...
But here’s why RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) makes all the difference:

🧩 Context matters – GPT can get confused with long/multiple inputs

📚 RAG = Smart search + LLM – It pulls only what’s relevant

🧠 Accurate, grounded answers – Based on your actual sources

🔎 Built-in citations – Know exactly where answers came from

TL;DR: RAG gives you faster, focused, factual answers from your sources.
